                </div>
                <p>The Doulos Biblical Seminary, founded in the year 2000, is a center of Christian Studies rooted and grounded primarily in the Holy Bible. It is Pentecostal in its character and positioned to prepare students for Christian Ministry. This seminary is the tangible product of the vision of its founder, Rev. V.P. Jose. It is a wing of the Doulos International Ministries, Inc and a part of the well-known India Gospel Team.</p>
                <p>While he was employed in Abu-Dhabi, United Arab Emirates in 1987, he was touched by the scripture Matthew 9:37-38 “the workers are few and the harvest is plentiful” and he recognized God’s call on him to work in the Lord’s vineyard. He decided to resign from his employment, left UAE and joined the Hebron Bible College, Kumbanad, Kerala as a part of his preparation for the ministry and on successful completion of a rigorous program of study he graduated from the College with a B. Th Degree. He has been a student of the word of God and studied at Eastern Baptist Theological Seminary Philadelphia for another B. Th and took his master's degree from Newburgh Theological Seminary Indiana and is now pursuing his D. Min at the same seminary.</p>
                <p>After graduation he pioneered two churches in Kerala and along with the pastoral ministry, he occupied himself as an itinerant speaker at various conventions and conferences on invitation.</p>
                <p>He immigrated to the U.S over three decades ago and has been continuously pastoring in I.P.C Churches for the last 30 years.  He served the Lord as the senior pastor in IPC Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, IPC Orlando, Florida, IPC Atlanta, Georgia, IPC Shalem Chicago, Illinois and is now serving as the Senior Pastor of IPC Shalem Grand Prairie, Texas. He has also been supporting the Gospel work in India with his own means in various capacities as God enabled.</p>
                <p>Doulos Biblical Seminary had its humble beginnings on Feb 15, 2000.  Pastor K.M John, then I.P.C President, prayerfully inaugurated the first batch of classes in its rented building at Mukkoottuthara, Erumeli. This town is at the seat of the Sri Ayappa Temple, a well-known Hindu Pilgrim Center of South India and the classes are successfully continuing without any disruptions. The Seminary offers C. Th, B. Th, M. Div degrees and a Bachelor’s degree in Counseling.</p>
                <p>Starting with just 25 students at our first commencement, we saw the continuous growth in enrollment of students along with God providing several well qualified and experienced professors in just the first few years. This growth soon required an expansion of our facilities. We now have a faculty of 22 professors who are visionaries committed to the cause of Christ. God provided a beautiful two-story building close to the Town Center in Vechoochira, on two and half acre land which is more than sufficient for the current needs.</p>
                <p>Presently the Seminary is run under the able day-to-day supervision of Principal Rev. Dr. Benson V. Yohannan. Our students come from various states of India and upon graduation they serve throughout the country as ministers of the Gospel.  We have almost 800 graduates in the mission field ministering as soul winners, Pastors, Bible Translators, Evangelists and Teachers.</p>
                <p>Due to the Covid-19 epidemic, the Seminary was compelled to close the in-person classes and utilized on-line classes enrolling students from far and near. 250 students are studying now on-line from many countries including the U.S., U.K., Canada, India and the Gulf States.  The students have now returned to campus as in-person classes have recently resumed. Doulos has three campuses in Kerala – in the cities of Trivandrum, Pandalam and Kuravilangadu.</p>
                <p>“Doulos Voice” is our online newsletter aiming to interpret contemporary social issues facing the world as seen through a believer’s eye.  It utilizes a well-balanced Ethical, Theological and Christian perspective.</p>
                <p>The Seminary has provided completely free tuition and boarding for our students for the last 21 years. We have not presented our needs to others or received financial support from any individual or organization from India or abroad.</p>
                <p>Starting in 2021, the College is accepting voluntary gifts from the students and a nominal fee from students enrolled in the M. Div program and in Counseling.</p>
